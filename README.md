# Demonstrating the Euclidean TSP App
This is an Android application coded in Kotlin using Jetpack compose. It is currently a work in progress but the final 
version will allow users to choose a random or selected set of nodes and are tasked with finding the shortest path 
between each of them. Once done it should run either Brute Force, Greedy or Held-Karp depending on the user selection 
and show the best result to the user.
